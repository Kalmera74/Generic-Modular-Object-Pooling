# Generic-Modular-Object-Pooling

This is a simple implementation of an object pooling system that uses ScriptableObjects. All the logic and proccesses are handled by the ScriptableObject. 
Thus, elimiating the need for having a MonoBehaviour instance in the scene and reference it. It is also implemented genericly so that it can be used with all
the Unity Objects.
